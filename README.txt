README

I, Jerry Li, entirely worked on this project by myself

However, zetcode 2d game tutorial was very helpful

I started 1/12/2013 and finished 1/19/2013

I worked about 20 hours on the project

The files required to start the project are all src. They are in packages (default),
game, images, sounds, util, and view.

All files used are in mentioned packages

**Cheat codes:**
pressing "l" skips level
pressing "b" makes enemies stop firing
pressing "e" ends game (win state)

**Possible bugs**
When the ship fires really fast, sometimes this generates an illegal state exception. Problem
is solved by making ship fire slower. My guess is that the game just can't keep up if there
are so many bullets firing and intersecting ships. Could not find definite fix, but making ship fire 
slower seems to solve the problem


**Impressions**
Definitely fun. Really enjoyed coding it. Did not enjoy the time it took. 20 hours a week is heavy.
Class lived up to reputation


******Submission update*****
Resubmitted because I deleted some unnecessary files and made sure I javadoc'ed everything.
